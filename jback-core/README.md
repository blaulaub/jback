# About

This module provides the business logic.


## Technologies and dependencies

This module tries to be mostly technology-neutral. It relies on
Spring Context for dependency injection. It does not impose any
particular DB, REST or security technology. Instead, these
concerns are expressed through interfaces that must be
implemented in other modules.
